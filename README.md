# Invisibility-Cloak
I have create an invisible cloak using Color detection and segmentation. In order to use this project, youâ€™ll need a single-color cloth. The cloth should not contain any other color visible. Here I have used a white paper as cloak. I have made a website which makes this project more interactive!<br>

(Note: The website may be slow since while capturing frames, there will be server lag for each frame)<br>

## Working
For this website to run, first you have to provide the color of the cloak which you want to use as your invisibility cloak.<br><br>

After this step, you have to provide a background image which will be used as reference for the invisibility cloak to work.<br><br>

After getting your background frame, your device camera will turn on again, and replace the area of cloak with the background in real time, and hence creating the effect of invisibility
